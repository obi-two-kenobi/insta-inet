# Insta-inet Control Panel

A reverse-engineered driver and Qt-based control application for Instalight 2022 LED panels, developed to give new life to discarded equipment for community use.

## üåü Project Overview

This project represents a complete reverse-engineering effort of the proprietary "Insta-inet" protocol used by Instalight 2022 LED panels. Instead of letting these panels end up in landfills, this driver enables communities to repurpose them for displays, art installations, and educational projects.

## üîß Protocol Documentation

### Insta-inet Packet Structure

The Insta-inet protocol consists of three main packet types: Discovery, Discovery Reply, and Data packets. All communication occurs over UDP.

**üìã Additional Protocol Information:** For detailed packet analysis, field mappings, and additional protocol documentation, refer to `insta-inet protocol documentation/INSTA-INET packets.xlsx` which contains comprehensive packet breakdowns and reverse-engineering notes.

#### 1. Discovery Packet (Panel Detection)

The discovery packet is broadcast to UDP port 9410 to locate panels on the network:

```cpp
struct DiscoveryPacket {
    uint8_t Insta_identifier[10] = {0x49, 0x4E, 0x53, 0x54, 0x41, 0x2D, 0x49, 0x4E, 0x45, 0x54}; // "INSTA-INET"
    uint8_t nul_terminator = 0x00;
    uint8_t version[2] = {0x01, 0x00};          // Protocol version
    uint8_t sendIndicator[2] = {0x00, 0x03};    // Discovery operation indicator
    uint8_t hostIP[5] = {0xC0, 0xA8, 0x02, 0xA7, 0x00}; // Host IP (192.168.2.167) with null terminator
    uint8_t op = 0x02;                          // Discovery operation code
    uint8_t unknown[5] = {0x55, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00}; // Unknown/padding fields
};
```

**Discovery Process:**
1. Broadcast this packet to the network (255.255.255.255:9410)
2. Panels respond with their IP addresses and status
3. The `hostIP` field should contain your computer's IP address
4. Panels use this information to establish communication

#### 2. Discovery Reply Packet (Panel Response)

Panels respond to discovery requests with their network information. The reply contains:
- Panel's IP address ‚úÖ
- Panel status and capabilities ‚ùì
- Network configuration details ‚úÖ

**IP Extraction:** The panel's IP address is extracted from the reply packet (byte 30-33), allowing the application to build a list of available panels for subsequent data transmission.

#### 3. Data Packet (Frame Transmission)

The main data packet structure used for sending RGB frame data and control parameters:

```cpp
struct DataPacket {
    uint8_t Insta_identifier[11] = {0x49, 0x4E, 0x53, 0x54, 0x41, 0x2D, 0x49, 0x4E, 0x45, 0x54, 0x00}; // "INSTA-INET\0"
    uint8_t version[2] = {0x01, 0x00};          // Protocol version
    uint8_t unknown0[2] = {0x00, 0x01};         // Unknown fields
    uint8_t TargetIP[5] = {0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00}; // Target panel IP with null terminator
    uint8_t op[2] = {0x01, 0x00};               // Data operation code
    uint8_t unknown1[2] = {0x01, 0x21};         // Unknown fields
    uint8_t counter = 0x00;                     // Frame counter (increments with each frame)
    uint8_t unknown2[9] = {0,0, 0,0,1,0xE6,0,0x1A,0}; // Unknown/timing fields
    
    // Left Channel Data (486 bytes total)
    uint8_t RGB_Left[162*3];         // RGB data for 162 LEDs (486 bytes)
    uint8_t L_Brightness = 0xC1;     // Left channel brightness (0-255)
    uint8_t L_Contrast = 0x7D;       // Left channel contrast (0-255)
    uint8_t L_Lumin_Time = 0x00;     // Left channel luminance timing (0-255)
    uint8_t L_Freq = 0x00;           // Left channel frequency (0-255)
    uint8_t L_Red_max = 0xFF;        // Left channel red maximum (0-255)
    uint8_t L_Green_max = 0xFF;      // Left channel green maximum (0-255)
    uint8_t L_Blue_max = 0xFF;       // Left channel blue maximum (0-255)
    uint8_t unknown3[46];            // Unknown/padding fields
    
    // Right Channel Data (486 bytes total)
    uint8_t RGB_Right[162*3];        // RGB data for 162 LEDs (486 bytes)
    uint8_t R_Brightness = 0xC1;     // Right channel brightness (0-255)
    uint8_t R_Contrast = 0x7D;       // Right channel contrast (0-255)
    uint8_t R_Lumin_Time = 0x00;     // Right channel luminance timing (0-255)
    uint8_t R_Freq = 0x00;           // Right channel frequency (0-255)
    uint8_t R_Red_max = 0xFF;        // Right channel red maximum (0-255)
    uint8_t R_Green_max = 0xFF;      // Right channel green maximum (0-255)
    uint8_t R_Blue_max = 0xFF;       // Right channel blue maximum (0-255)
    uint8_t unknown4[46];            // Unknown/padding fields
};
```

#### 4. Predata Packet (Continuous Keep-Alive)

**Critical Implementation Detail:** The panels require a continuous "predata" packet to maintain communication and prevent timeout. This packet must be broadcast to all panels (255.255.255.255) on port 9410 at regular intervals (typically every 30-100ms).

**Predata Packet Structure:**
```cpp
struct preDataPacket {
    uint8_t Insta_identifier[10] = {0x49, 0x4E, 0x53, 0x54, 0x41, 0x2D, 0x49, 0x4E, 0x45, 0x54}; // "INSTA-INET"
    uint8_t nul_terminator0 = 0x00;
    uint8_t version = 0x01;
    uint8_t nul_terminator1 = 0x00;
    uint8_t unknown0[2] = {0x00, 0x01};         // Unknown fields
    uint8_t TargetIP[4] = {0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF}; // Broadcast address (255.255.255.255)
    uint8_t nul_terminator2 = 0x00;
    uint8_t op = 0x08;                          // Predata operation code
    uint8_t nul_terminator3 = 0x00;
    uint8_t unknown1[5] = {0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00}; // Unknown/padding fields
};
```

**Broadcasting Requirements:**
- **Destination**: Broadcast to 255.255.255.255:9410
- **Frequency**: Sent continuously before each data packet transmission
- **Threading**: Must run in dedicated background thread
- **Purpose**: Announces host presence and maintains panel connectivity

**Threading Implementation:**
```cpp
// Predata packet must run continuously in background thread
void TransmitData(std::vector<instaLight2022>* panels, int port = 9410, 
                  bool debug = false, float fps = 30.0f);
```

**Purpose of Predata Packet:**
- Maintains active connection with all panels simultaneously
- Prevents communication timeout across the entire panel network
- Synchronizes frame transmission timing for multi-panel setups
- Ensures panels remain responsive to subsequent data packets
- Broadcasts host IP presence to the network

**Implementation Notes:**
- Must run in separate thread to avoid blocking main application
- Broadcast nature allows single packet to reach all panels
- Operation code 0x08 distinguishes it from discovery (0x02) and data (0x01) packets
- Failure to maintain predata stream results in panels becoming unresponsive
- Frame rate parameter controls the predata transmission frequency

### Protocol Communication Flow

1. **Discovery Phase:**
   - Broadcast discovery packet
   - Collect panel IP addresses from replies
   - Build panel list for data transmission

2. **Initialization Phase:**
   - Start predata transmission thread
   - Establish communication with each discovered panel
   - Verify panel responsiveness

3. **Data Transmission Phase:**
   - Send RGB frame data to panels
   - Adjust panel parameters (brightness, contrast, etc.)
   - Maintain continuous predata stream

4. **Shutdown Phase:**
   - Stop predata transmission
   - Clean up network connections
